Donations & Advertising monies received from you (your organisation) goes directly to pay the staff salaries in Sri Lanka. In other words, your donations & advertising money goes to better the lives of a small IT team and their families in Sri Lanka. eLanka services like article publishing, photo gallery of events, event publishing, newsletter, are all free of charge services to the Sri Lankan community. eLanka has over 25,000 members and on a weekly basis we send out a Free eNewsletter to our members of events, news and your (your organisation’s) advertising information. Advertising monies received from you (your organisation) goes directly to support a small IT team in Sri Lanka. eLanka has over 1000 people a day visiting the website to read News from Sri Lanka, View Photos of events in Australia, as well as read about upcoming events in Australia and visit the eLanka Business Directory to view the advertisers such as you (your organisation) who can be trusted to provide a good service. ========================================== Services & Terms and Conditions for each Service eLanka’s mission is to Promote all businesses wishing to advertise their product or service offering to the Sri Lankan community based in Australia, by displaying their business contact details on the eLanka.com.au Promote your business product or service via an email to the eLanka member mailing list. A large database of most Sri Lankan individuals and business email addresses based in Australia. Promote your special event (e.g. dinner dance, sporting event, special business promotion) via email to eLanka.com.au member mailing list. Design and host cost effective web sites. eLanka.com.au has three main service offerings for advertising: E-mail Marketing Services & Terms and Conditions: This is a subsidised service offering to the Sri Lankan community to assist them with their advertising needs to promote their product or service to the largest database of Sri Lankans living in Australia. This service offering is also open to all members of the general public and organisations, including those companies in Sri Lanka wishing to promote their services or products to the Sri Lankan community in Australia. One of the key services that eLanka.com.au provides is an email marketing campaign that we do by sending out specially designed email web pages to a large member list consisting of Sri Lankan people living in Sydney, Melbourne & Brisbane Note that this method of advertising is not “Spamming”, but “Permission based marketing” where all the eLanka.com.au members provide their email address via this web site. We only hold the member email address details on our database servers. With this structure, if you can forward a graphically designed advertisement (as a word or image file), then a web based flier is designed by us. Once the web based flier is designed, the proof is first sent to you for approval, and upon confirmation we send it out to the large eLanka.com.au members in our database. Responses to the email from members are either forwarded to your email address (if we receive any responses) or they contact the person’s email address that is on the flier. If you don’t have a graphically designed flier, we can assist you with the design of the advertisement at a very cost effective price. We also do a follow up email marketing campaign just before the event at 2/3 the price as well. This is so that the members will remember of the event or product that they were told about some weeks back. We have found such email marketing campaigns to be very effective over the past years with some successful ad campaigns we have done for events & products both in Australia & Sri Lanka. Email Marketing can be carried out as a separate once off price starting from $75 set up + $50 per campaign, or as part of our Banner advertising campaign (see Business Card display Prices below) Business Card Display Services & Terms and Conditions: If you visit the Business Directory of eLanka website, you will notice how a directory of business card display has been set up. You can pick several categories to display your product or service offering in this business directory. The cost of advertising your business card here will depend on the categories of advertising, banner advertisement requirements and any email marketing programme you would require. Note that if we do the full design of your web site, or use the email marketing programme, then this card display will be free. Please email neil@eLanka.com.au your contact number or email address so that we can call you to provide further info. Or, in turn, please call eLanka to discuss further details. Your Business Card can be displayed on the eLanka Business Directory in several categories. Web Design Services & Terms and Conditions: eLanka.com.au service has a radically reduced pricing structure to assist the Sri Lankan communities & business ventures in setting up their web sites. We can assist you with your domain name registration for the web site (ie www.yourbusinessname.com.au), and once the design is done, even with hosting your web site within our outsourced secure hosting environments.

Uses If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the eLanka Sites, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the general and personalized features and functionality of the eLanka website, and to process any flagging activity or correspondence you send to us. We may use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the eLanka websites; provide custom, personalized content and information; monitor the effectiveness of our marketing promotions; monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.

However, please note that if an advertiser asks eLanka to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 25-30) or audience segment (for example, men ages 25-30 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the eLanka Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you. You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. eLanka’s privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, such other advertisers or web sites.

Kusal Mendis had been at the Pakistan Super League (PSL) with Quetta Gladiators until last week, playing as their wicketkeeper-batter. He’d last played for them on May 7. But ESPNcricinfo has learned he will not travel to Pakistan for the remainder of the PSL due to perceived safety concerns, and has now pivoted to playing in the IPL, a league in which he has never previously appeared. Buttler’s unavailability for the playoffs is down to his having been named in England’s ODI squad for the home series against West Indies, which starts on May 29. The IPL’s playoffs ...

During his life and after his death, he became the subject of several studies by Sri Lankan and foreign scholars. Today his paintings have found their way to some of the biggest art collections in his country, as well as to places like Christie’s and Sotheby’s. Taken together, these paintings represent some of the finest examples of modern art in Sri Lanka and Asia. They have also become symbols of Asian modernism. Born in 1901 in the mountainous region of Kandy, some 75 miles from Sri Lanka’s capital, Colombo, George Keyt hailed from a middle-class family that had become thoroughly Westernised and Anglicised. They belonged to the Burgher community, an ethnic group which traces its descent from ...

There are conflicting accounts of who took part in the first meeting and who did not. Lester James Peries remembered seeing George Keyt, Justin Daraniyagala, Geoffrey Beling, and Manjusri, while Richard Gabriel remembered coming across Daraniyagala, Beling, Lester Peries, Harry Pieris, and Ivan Peries. The minutes of the meeting, however, do not mention Keyt, Daraniyagala, Beling, and Manjusri, while Gabriel pointedly denied seeing Manjusri there. Citing official records, Neville Weeraratne records that seven people attended the meeting: Ivan and Lester Peries, Aubrey Collette, George Claessen, Richard Gabriel, Harry Pieris, and Lionel Wendt.

(There would be more swimming pools here, in Australia than anywhere else in the World), and I am quite certain of this. The reason for this brief, but important article of mine, is simply to ‘touch’ on the ‘Madness’ I write about when it comes to Sports in general. A Sport like Swimming is safe enough, I would suppose. Even ‘water-polo’ is hazard-proof, as the ball tossed around, would have to be less ‘felt’, having its impetus lessened by the water it emanates from.

The Putin-Zelenskyy saga will never end until Putin gets his pound of flesh, as he claims. Trump, acting as the matchmaker or marriage broker, actively advocated for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, recently holding a two-hour call with Russian President Vladimir Putin. After their discussion, Trump shared the exciting news that Russia and Ukraine would “immediately” start discussing a ceasefire. While Trump feels hopeful about this development, it’s important to note that Putin hasn’t fully committed to an unconditional ceasefire, emphasising that the underlying issues of the conflict need to be addressed first. In an encouraging step forward, Trump also reached out to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who is advocating for stronger sanctions on Russia if Putin doesn’t agree to a ceasefire.

This complex interplay has attracted heightened attention in recent years owing to its significant implications for both physical and mental health.

When my Dad and Mum heard of this, he invited our Choir Master Mr. Cyril Brown and the choristers to stop at our bungalow for Breakfast  – an invitation which was gladly accepted. The photograph taken that day on the front lawn after Breakfast, with Dad and Mum in the center in the front row.

This article is pursuant to the one I last wrote for eLanka “Three religions and a Kingdom – The Glory of Angkor Wat.” The concluding paragraph of that article dealt with the diplomatic relations between medieval Polonnaruwa when King Parakramabahu the Great ruled Lanka and the Khmer empire, ruling from Angkor Wat in Kampuchea. (Cambodia). For reasons of brevity, I omitted to write the concluding paragraph which deals with King Parakramabahu’s foreign policy which had wider ramifications for two countries in South East Asia, Burma and Cambodia. For reasons of clarity Bagan in this article refers to the City – State of Burma, or Myanmar as the country is known today. KING PARAKRAMABAHU THE VISIONARY.

Dr.Henri Mouhot the French Naturalist was doing what he loved best, searching for new species of flora in a leafy green forest which was his passion. Pressing even deeper into a green kingdom glinting with birds of every variety, and  flora and fauna of every description, tropical heat notwithstanding, he set to work with a passion. Suddenly, something in the forest beyond caught his eye. Amid the thickets he and his workers spotted a massive structure that resembled what looked like a temple and colossal stone steps thrown down by trees which had grow between the crevices, and reached a terrace the form of which was impossible to make out. As a guide cleared a path with his machete, they came across another colossal structure half buried in the density of ...

THE PRAMBANAN HINDU TEMPLES OF EAST JAVA – by Bernard VanCuylenburg After a spellbinding tour of the Borobudur Monument I took the road well travelled to Yogyakarta, because North East of this great city I was aware of another cultural pearl which for the past 1200 years has kept a silent vigil in majestic splendour, lost to the world in the solitude of the jungle defying time and the elements, until it was discovered in 1885. These are the spectacular Hindu temples of Prambanan which are the best examples of ancient Java’s Hindu culture, and Indonesia’s most outstanding example of Hindu art. I visited the site early morning when the majestic Shiva temples were punctuating the morning mists to present their timeless profiles to the new day. All the temples in the area were built between the 8th and10th centuries AD when religious harmony prevailed ...

By day and at night, the only sounds were those of the leopard, or the shrieking of monkeys, the piercing trill of birds, and other denizens of the jungle.  For over a thousand years, Borobudur the largest Buddhist monument in the world, was a word that was only a spectral memory, confined to the realms of invisibility. The eternal reverie of this architectural marvel came back to life in 1815 when it was rediscovered by a Dutch Engineer working under Sir Thomas Raffles the Governor of Java. This chance discovery which was one of the greatest archaeological discoveries at the time revealed the magnitude of the builders and architect’s ...

PROLOGUE. This story is about a Monk, a Buddha, and two rivers, which had its genesis over 1500 years ago in Leshan China, on a cliff face overlooking the confluence of the Dadu and Min rivers. Before I get to the crux of this article, some context by reference to the two statues of the Buddha in the Bamiyan valley in Afghanistan is timely. The destruction of the Bamiyan Buddha statues in 2001 signalled the loss of a priceless legacy to humanity, and dealt a fatal blow to the cultural sensitivities of the world. One statue stood 180 ft tall, and the other was 124 ft. Both statues over 2000 years old stood in an area which was a holy site for Buddhists, on the ancient trading route between China and Europe known as The Silk ...

Long after the tears have been shed, it remains a lingering heartache in the psyche and spirit of Sri Lanka and an archaeological treasure where the full gamut of human emotions   – anger, hatred, revenge, greed, murder, and  lust for power, have been played out to the maximum. The events that unfolded on  that fateful day over 1600 years ago still resonate today, which is why Sigiriya is perhaps the most visited historic site in the island. The protagonists in this drama, King Dhatusena, Prince Kasyappa, Prince Moggallana, and the commander of the army Migara ,who was King Dhatusena’s son-in-law are names ...

There is an old saying that “Good friends come into our lives too late, and leave too early”. Antonians of a younger generation may have only heard of Gordon Cooray by name. Citing my own example – I joined St. Anthony’s College in January 1951 and Gordon left college in 1953 or 1954. I only made Gordon’s acquaintance when I came to Australia 6 months short of forty years in this country. But it was forty years in which I found that Gordon by virtue of whom he was, made the world a better place for me and many others. He gave of himself in the service of his fellow human beings, and often walked the extra mile for anybody who sought his assistance or advice.  The Memorial Mass held for Gordon Cooray on Sunday the 14th ...

Pursuant to the articles which I wrote last year, “An Odyssey – A Search for Heritage, parts 1 and 2 “) following a foray into the cornucopia of ruins buried in deep jungle well off the beaten track, I embarked on a similar venture in March this year. I am passionately moved by the treasure trove of what could be the best in ancient Sinhala civilization, possibly the life force of Sinhala culture which remains buried in the sands still awaiting the archaeologists spade, and I wish to share my experience with a wider circle of lovers of history. Parting the veil of time, an unknown sculptor, architect, engineer, master craftsman, even a poet, reached out to me and held my hand leading me across the centuries in my quest.

Eighty Club Country and Western night a huge success at Trevine Rodrigo Gallant Tuskers give Small Blacks a scare before succumbing to a 2-0 series loss.  – BY TREVINE RODRIGO IN MELBOURNE.  (eLanka Sports Editor). New Zealand arrived in Sri Lanka with no knowledge of what to expect against the locals in Rugby Union.They left the country gobsmacked by the passion, talent and crazy following of the game by the locals. Yes, they proved superior, technically and with their slick ball movement which was never unexpected from a country which regards Rugby as a religion. But the ‘Small Blacks’, due to the weight restriction of 85kg, showed why Rugby Union in Asia and the best in the world have a yawning gap apart from Japan, who are bolstered by the inclusion of expatriate Pacific Islanders and are rated highly in the world game.  The new concept certainly has the potential to expand the game and encourage teams such as Sri Lanka to ...

Sri Lanka’s women are firming as a genuine contender to the world’s best after a supercharged win over India in the tri-series also featuring South Africa.  Level on win/loss points with India, it is shaping as a India/ Sri Lanka final in if things go to plan in Colombo. Set an imposing target of 275 by India, Sri Lanka’s girls set about the chase with careful planning, and smashed their way to 278 for7 in a memorable three wicket win with five balls to spare. India are rated second in the world to Australia so the Sri Lankan success, immaterial of whether they win the tournament or not, suggests they are a danger team against anyone.  They need to improve their success away from home.  Chamari Athapaththu will be ...

If there was lessons learnt in rugby, Sri Lanka’s Tuskers can reflect on an awakening of how to construct a win with a simple mindset, and a focus on basics, taught to them by the mini All Blacks, or ‘Small Blacks ‘ as I choose to call them, in Nittawela. The historic contest between the two nations which attracted a mammoth rugby following from the hill country, lived upto all expectations as the young brigade from one of the best Rugby Union nations in the world, showed how it can to be done.

A warm and extremely hospitable couple, they portray the glowing example of how true love can conquer all else despite the rollercoaster ride that life presents. I was invited to join in a private celebration at the Springvale RSL and the low key family and close friend get-together proved that extravagant parties are not the end all to register lasting memories of an important milestone.

The contestants or even the famous chef’s just cook without due care for any wastage of energy, may be because they do not have to meet the energy bill. Poisonous gases given out while cooking Researchers now understand that the process of cooking food and even simply operating stoves particularly gas appliances can emit a cocktail of potentially hazardous chemicals and compounds. Within our homes, these pollutants are less diluted than they are outdoors, and in the absence of proper ventilation, they often get trapped inside.

Those operations which I’ll talk about is energy wasted in cooking. What is cooking? Cooking is one of those everyday words that everyone knows. But what does it really mean? Is reheating leftovers cooking? How about making an emulsified salad dressing? Scrambling eggs? Baking cookies?

Most of the habits I have picked up have been from my dad, and naturally after getting my licence, that has not changed. What I did not realise prior to passing my driver’s licence is that driving come with A LOT of responsibility. Not just the obvious be safe on the road stuff, but the number of things you keep in your mind when you’re not driving alone is immense! Driving slower than usual, breaking quicker than usual, accelerating smoothly so no one jumps in their seat, making sure you have a rout mapped out if you have multiple people to pick up, making sure you are on time! The amount of times I have been late ... May 1, 2018 Posted by eLanka admin In Articles , Natali Perera Tagged DRIVER EDICATE - By Natali Perera Read More → NATS’ TAKE PASSENGER EDICATE – By Natali Perera Getting my licence made me think about what type of passenger I was. I would look at various people who got into my car and think to myself, do I act like that? Do I do what they’re doing right now? Small things like wanting to open the window instead of turning on the aircon in the car; that makes a difference to the driver! That drumming noise the wind makes when you don’t have all your windows open the right amount, that’s enough to burst a drum. So this made me think, is there such a thing as passenger edicate? Are there just some things that passengers should avoid doing when they are being driven around? With exception obviously, these are the rules that I believe all passengers should be considerate about: Lateness complaints, you are being given a lift. At least ...

OR FRIENDLY? By Natali Perera   How much talking is too much talking? How do you know, when they’re calling you as a friend, and when they’re calling you because they want to hear about your day? This is such a fine line. Personally, I feel like if talking exceeds to once a day, then there may be some feelings involved. I mean, I don’t even talk to my best friends every day…if you think about calling someone after work, when you’re driving or when you’re bored then you should be thinking about why you want to talk to them so much, because I don’t think you just want to call in a friendly way anymore, you want to call in a freeeeeendly way. If you catch my drift. Now days, with social media and texting, there isn’t really any reason why people ... May 1, 2018 Posted by eLanka admin In Articles , Natali Perera Tagged FLIRTY? OR FRIENDLY?

But it also brings with it the potential need to cancel out the things that are not need in our lives. I always thought of January as the month of cleansing, in every aspect of my life! My friends and I have a few unspoken theories. One, is that if anything bad happens in January, it is the universe’s way of trying to make you a path filled with great things for the rest of the 11/12 months. For example, if work is not going as smoothly as you would like, no worries, the mistakes you made, are in the past, you made them and that’s done, you have 11 more months to make up for it so utilise them all. ...

At first, I thought maybe it was through trial and error. One day, many years ago, someone somewhere decided to lie about something. The outcome was negatively related, and hence, the individual decided that honesty was the best policy for future similar situations. Obviously, a quick search into google informed me that it was in fact a proverb from Benjamin Franklin. ...

This time, happily, it is a different story, originally submitted to the Newsletter I regularly receive from the C.W.O. (Ceylonese Welfare Organisation), by a lady with a subtle sense of humour. As I now do, especially for the thousands of “on-line” readers of eLanka, I first contact the original scribe, in this case, “unknown”, then add-on, a little extra, as I am doing right now, to now bring you the “tale” of Farmer Jones, his favourite Rooster, Butch, his brood of “free-range” hens, “free-range” eggs (the preferred ones for human consumption, as far as I am concerned), Politicians & even hopeful “Peace-Prize” winners like Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un. Anyway, here’s hoping that all my readers enjoy reading this story, as much as I enjoyed writing it for you. Farmer John Jones was in the “Fertilized egg business”. He had several hundred young “layers”, or “Pullets”, as they are called, plus ten Roosters to fertilize all the eggs to come. He kept strict records on their performance, and any Rooster, not performing, was duly sentenced to the “soup- pot” & replaced. All these logistics took too much of his time, and so he decided to attach a tiny bell on the foot of each Rooster, each bell emitting a different “tone”, so that, even from a distance John could tell which of his Roosters was either performing, or not doing his job. This was a canny move by John, who could now just sit on the porch of his farmhouse to complete the efficiency reports of his business. He did this now, by listening to the bells on his chook-farm. Farmer John’s favourite Rooster was “Butch”. All was going well, until, one sunny morning, he noticed that old Butch’s bell wasn’t sounding at all, so off he went to investigate the matter. What he found was amazing. All the othrr Roosters were busily chasing the hens, bells a-ringin, bluebirds singin, but the pullets were running (for cover), when they heard the Roosters coming. Then John confronted Butch to find his bell firmly lodged in his beak, so it wouldn’t ring. He (Butch) would then sneak up on a Pullet, do his job, walk away to sneak up on another. Farmer John was so proud of Butch, he entered him in the “County-fair”, where Butch became an overnight sensation with all the judges. These Judges not only awarded old Butch with the “No-bell” Peace Prize, they awarded him with the “Pullet-sur-prize” as well . Clearly, Butch was a Politician. Watch out, Trump & Un, who else but a Politician could figure out how to win (by default), two of the most coveted awards on this Planet of ours, by being champions at sneaking up on an unsuspecting populace and screwing them, when they weren’t paying attention !.

The six full members of the ICC were automatic choices for the 1975 World Cup and in a bid to make up the numbers, Sri Lanka and a team comprising cricketers from East Africa were invited to play the inaugural event. The quality of Sri Lankan cricket was displayed on this day at The Oval against an Australian side comprising the Chappell brothers, Dennis Lille, Jeff Thomson and others. A century by Alan Turner and half-centuries by Rick McCosker, Greg Chappell, and Doug Walters had propelled Australia to a total of 328. Many would have thought that Sri Lanka had little chance. But they did well; reaching 150 for two and needed 179 runs in 30 overs with eight wickets in hand.  Australian skipper Ian Chappell was a worried man. Duleep Mendis and Sunil Wettimuny were out in the middle and yet to come were the team’s two best batsmen – Anura Tennekoon and Michael Tissera. Chappell’s last throw of the dice was to call up Jeff Thomson, who needed no invitation for aggression. On a placid Oval pitch, Wettimuny and Mendis were making merry until Thomson came in for his second spell. The two batsmen were subjected to a barrage of short-pitched bowling. Wettimuny was left with a broken hip bone and a broken foot while Mendis was hit right on the center of the temple. Mendis was set for his favourite cut shot, but the ball swung back sharply to hit him. There was no first aid at The Oval and no stretcher to carry the batsman off. He was taken to the nearby St.  Thomas’ Hospital. Wettimuny had gone onto become the first Sri Lankan to score a half-century in an international match and soon he too joined Mendis at the hospital. Celebrated cricket writer Jack Staggles visited the two Sri Lankans at the hospital. In the story he published the next day, a quote from Mendis described the man. “What happened was one of those things. It would not bother me in the slightest if I had to go out and face Thomson again tomorrow. It would take more than this to intimidate me.” Mendis was 22 then and his courage and grit was visible. The same traits were seen as he held many other responsible positions of Sri Lankan cricket over the next four decades. An insatiable passion for the game, no-nonsense approach, and his visionary thinking saw the game thriving under his charge. Some of the decisions he took weren’t the most popular ones, but leaders are meant to take those unpopular decisions with the well being of the institution they serve in mind. Some of the problems that Sri Lankan cricket faces at the moment wouldn’t have happened had Mendis been around as the CEO of SLC. How on earth Sri Lanka Cricket decided to promote a gym assistant to the post of Assistant Venue Manager of the Galle International Stadium is beyond our comprehension. Ousted SLC chief Thilanga Sumathipala owes an explanation to the cricket loving public in this country. It was this Assistant Venue Manager who was caught by the Al Jazeera sting that investigated corruption in cricket. The hallmark of some of our politicians is to appoint clowns and cronies around them to important positions. Thilanga Sumathipala is no different. National Curator is one of the most prestigious positions in the cricket board held by some fine individuals over the years.  But under Thilanga this has been compromised and one of his confidants – Godfrey Dabare was appointed for the position. It was Godfrey’s suggestion to promote Tharanga Indika, who was caught in the sting operation, to be promoted as Assistant Venue Manager. Had Mendis been the CEO of SLC, he would have vehemently opposed such a move. Thilanga also has been criticized heavily for almost doubling the number of teams with First Class status. With the likes of Mendis sitting on the Executive Committee meetings, such a resolution wouldn’t have got passed so easily. When Thilanga won the cricket elections in 2016, there was a move to bring Duleep back into the Sri Lankan cricket fold from Oman. In the end, the efforts didn’t materialize. It was said that SLC wasn’t fit enough to match the remuneration package that Oman had offered Mendis. Surely, given the deals that SLC has signed with some individuals in recent times, roping in Mendis was a child’s play. Perhaps why Thilanga didn’t aggressively persuade to bring Mendis back home was because that he knows that with the likes of him around, there wouldn’t be smooth sailing all the time. The position SLC was going to offer Mendis was team Manager. We learn that individuals within the SLC Ex-Co were eyeing for the position of Team Manager. When SLC terminated Mendis’ services as CEO in 2010, The Island pointed out the injustices meted out to one of the greats of the sport. SLC responded saying that Mendis was paid three months of his salary and was allowed to keep his car valued at Rs. 3.5 million as compensation. We then pointed out that the service rendered by Mendis to Sri Lankan cricket is invaluable and it cannot be measured in terms of rupees and cents or aging automobiles. Today Sri Lankan cricket is paying a heavy price for getting rid of such visionary thinkers.

Of course, the top teams at the moment would like them to remain where they are because of their enviable record since gaining Test status in 1982. The successes they have achieved since then far surpasses many other countries who have been in the top bracket for far more years with little to show for it. Definitely not suffering from a lack of available talent, the Sri Lankan dilemma appears to be centered around the current structure and administrative input which has taken them back to the dark ages when they were whipping boys to the rest of the world. Losing a top coach in South African Graham Ford due to reported political meddling appeared to spell doom and gloom to the islanders but fortunately or dare I say questionably they managed to net another top-class coach in Chandika Hathurusinghe whose drawback may be that he is home grown which may yet have a detrimental effect on how he goes about his duties if he is not given a free hand. Knowing Hathurusinghe and his fierce determination to prevail over adversity in order to succeed as he did when Sri Lanka discarded him as an assistant coach where he went on to great things in Australia and as Bangladesh coach, it may not be long or surprising, before he abandons a lost cause if things don’t go to his plan. Since Hathurusinghe took over the reins, the islanders have recorded limited success mainly due to inconsistency and lack of experience within the squad and compounding their plight has been the failure of the experienced brigade such as Skipper Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Perera and a few others with the only reliable player, former skipper Angelo Matthews plagued by injury and unavailable more times than not. The fitness and physical preparation of the team also appear questionable judging by the ins and outs of players which also affects team gelling. Currently in the West Indies and staring down the barrel of yet another hiding in the 3-Test series, Sri Lanka’s plight can only get worse in the daunting encounters ahead of them against the top rungers of the game whom they encounter unless they can unravel a dramatic turnaround to their fortunes through consistency and a more committed approach. Sri Lanka were thrashed by 226 runs in the first Test in Port-of-Spain. There appears to be a fair amount of talent in the existing pool but exposure and perseverance at the initial stages particularly among the younger players may play an important role in establishing a team of world beaters. Youngsters Dananjaya De Silva, Kusal Mendis and Dilruwan Perera must be persevered with until they get to the next level while Matthews and Chandimal try to re-discover their lost momentum. Blessed with a rich cricketing culture and a deep history in the game, there has to be successors to their legends of the past that have won worldwide admiration such as Aravinda De Silva, Arjuna Ranatunga, Asanka Gurusinha, Sanath Jayasuriya, Romesh Kaluwitharne, Mahela Jayawardena, Kumar Sangakkara, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Chaminda Vaas and a few others who were themselves successors to some fantastic players such as Michael Tissera, Anura Tennakoon, Sidath Wettimuny, Roy Dias, Duleep Mendis, Ranjan Madugalle and Rumesh Ratnayake just to name a few, when they made their initial foray on the world stage. The above-mentioned players were fiercely competitive with controlled aggression which in many players around the world is the ultimate catalyst to producing champions not just in Cricket but any sport. Cricket, like Sevens Rugby is to Fiji, is the only sport that Sri Lanka are able to compete on an even keel with the best in the world. So, their focus should be on nurturing what they have got and being the best at it. Sadly, at this stage the cavalier globetrotters of the recent past are nowhere close to their desired goal.

Her Father, Mario was a celebrated designer to movie mogul, the late Howard Hughes, her Mother Maureen was a model & beauty queen, the very first to “put Ceylon on the map”, as a runner-up in the ” Miss Universe” contest of 1956. Gina died on the 21st of May, 2018 aged just 59, but not before she made her own “name” by becoming the very first female American, L.A. based Concert Promoter, Pasadena’s best “Citizen of the year”for her work with the “Preservation Foundation” of California, and she sat on the “Board of Directors” for “Hollywood Heritage”. She also formed a non- profit organization “Friends of the Raymond Theatre”, whose mission was to save this historic building. She waged a long 20 year battle to preserve this theatre, which, as a historian, she loved. The Los Angeles Times Newspaper of the 25th of October 1990 wrote thus:, “Raymond Theatre has a Champion in Gina Zamparelli” After a short illness, Gina died after being diagnosed with “Glioblastoma” , an aggressive cancer of the brain & her funeral will be held at a local Roman Catholic Church on the 16th of June, after which a celebration of her life will probably see hundreds of her friends and fans come together to reminisce about a great lady, taken away much too soon. As the Editor of eLanka, & “The Lanka Times” in Melbourne, I take this chance to send our deepest sympathy to Gina’s family in America, especially to her Mum & Sister, Marisa, plus everyone in Los Angeles & America who thought the World of Gina Zamparelli. May she now rest in peace. “Goodbye Gina, God bless you”. Desmond Kelly.

It is always a virus infection and never bacterial, unless you get affected secondarily whilst suffering from a common cold. There are many viruses that can cause a cold and the most common one is the rhinovirus. Other less common ones are- adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, and so on. Rhinovirus is more potent than the others as it can cause other infections like pneumonia, otitis (ear infections), sinus and throat infections, and can trigger an asthma attack. You could always diagnose a cold without seeing your doctor: runny nose, (sniffles), sore throat, ear ache and fever. Unlike bacterial infections, viral infections have a life span- may be a week or two and you getting better. Unfortunately, you do not acquire immunity from further future infections- meaning the same virus can inflict a recurrent infection. The common cold can spread in a household to every member and is contagious. The incubation period is about 24 hours Remember, there are no antibiotics that will kill any viral disease. You can only temporise to feel better by drinking plenty of fluids, home remedies, and taking over the counter cough mixtures, throat lozenges, and inhalations. You still need to go through the life cycle of the virus. If the sinus infection and sore throat lasts longer than 10 days, you should see your doctor, and he is bound to give you antibiotics to end the secondary infection. Your doctor will invariably order x-rays to check your sinuses. When your nose is blocked, inhale steam to soothe the nasal congestion. You may use a nasal spray, instead. Saline nasal solutions help break up nasal congestion and remove virus particles. A good at- home solution would be to mix 3 teaspoons of iodine-free salt and 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and place the mixture in an airtight container. Use 1 teaspoon of this mixture with 8 ounces of warm distilled water. Fill a plastic syringe and squirt the solution into the nose while holding the head over the sink. The other nostril should be closed. Post-nasal drip In most situations when your nose is congested with nasal discharges, there is a tendency for this secretion to dribble down into your throat and most coughing in the nights is due to this dribble. Antihistamines and decongestants may help to dry your throat and get rid of the excessive mucus. Cortisone based nasal decongestants do help to dry your nostril mucosa to prevent further post nasal drips (PND) Viral infections are referred to as upper respiratory infection because it is limited to the nasal passages, sinuses and may be your throat. Wash your hands as a habit daily to prevent a cold. Use an alcohol-based sanitizer product, or soap and water. Avoid going into crowded areas, and keep away from the cold weather, especially the winter season, if you can. Zinc tablets for cold Zinc tablets are supposed to prevent people getting colds, but studies has shown mixed results about zinc and colds. Zinc may prevent the rhinovirus from multiplying in your nasal passages and throat. It may be effective when taken in lozenges or syrup form, which allows the substance to stay in your throat and attack the virus. Zinc in lozenge form may have side effects, including nausea or bad taste in your mouth. You may lose your smell permanently when you use a zinc nasal spray. Vitamin C While earlier studies reported that taking vitamin C reduced how long a cold would stick around, the current consensus is that for the general population, it is ineffective. However, there are certain groups of individuals who may benefit from vitamin C when a cold is looming. These include people who undertake severe physical exercise, those exposed to cold environments, and those with vitamin C levels below the recommended levels. Drinking milk whilst having a cold Drinking mild may increase the amount of phlegm, and make it thicker and irritate your throat. Milk does not cause your body to make phlegm. Chicken soup Warm chicken soup is soothing when you have a cold. Chicken soup thins the mucus and also supposed to be ‘anti-inflammatory’. Rest You need to rest when you have a cold. Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water, juices like lemon containing high concentrations of vitamin C, Tea, warm apple juice, might be soothing and help ease congestion by increasing mucus flow. Sip hot lemon with honey for an irritable cough. Avoid alcohol, coffee and caffeinated sodas, which can make your dehydration worse. Drinking tea with honey and lemon: This can ease a sore throat and researchers have found honey to be an effective cough suppressant. Drinking hot water with fresh ginger: This can reduce feelings of nausea associated with the flu. The onion in sock home remedy has origins in western folklore and is hundreds of years old. It also has links to the Chinese practice of reflexology. Many people claim that the onion in sock remedy is an effective treatment for a cold or the flu. Despite these claims, there is no scientific evidence to support this. There are no proven health benefits to this remedy, but it is not known to be harmful. What’s the difference between cold and Flu? At the onset, both colds and Flu have similar symptoms… Both are caused by viruses, and not bacteria, and you feel miserable. In a cold you get a runny, stuffy blocked nose and in flu only mildly occasionally. You sneeze more with colds and less with Flu. Coughing is more common with a cold with a mucus discharge, whilst in Flu you get a dry cough. A sore throat is more common with a cold and occasionally with Flu. Body aches and pains are mild with a cold and more severe with Flu. It is rare to get fever, chills and sweats with a cold but always present in Flu Symptoms come about slowly in a cold and may take days while it comes fast within hours with Flu. A cold you could get any time of the year, more during winter months, but flu is more seasonal. Only influenza viruses cause the flu, while many different viruses can cause colds. There is a vaccine to prevent the flu, while there is no vaccine to prevent the common cold. Adults have an average of two to three colds a year, but only get the flu about twice a decade. Kids get colds and the flu more frequently. Flu tends to give worse problems, especially among the children and the old people, and may lead to pneumonia needing hospitalization. Men have a weaker immune response. Research has shown that men have a weaker immune response to viruses that cause flu, or the common cold, and as a result, men may have a greater risk of serious symptoms than women. Is ‘Man Flu’ a Real Thing? A Canadian researcher says there is some evidence that hormones and other factors may make men more susceptible to serious cases of the flu. In a 2008 study it was found that women had a stronger immune response to the flu vaccine, meaning they produce greater levels of antibodies against the virus strains in the vaccine, compared with men. The flu viruses in circulation change each season, and the predominant strain this year is H3N2, according to the new CDC report. Flu seasons in which H3N2 predominates tend to have higher overall flu hospitalization and death rates, according to the CDC. However, in order to make the flu vaccine, manufacturers typically use chicken eggs to “grow” the flu virus strains. During this process, the flu strains may acquire genetic changes that make the strains slightly different from those in circulation. This appears to have happened with the H3N2 component of this year’s flu vaccine, the report said, and the changes may lower the effectiveness of the vaccine. (However, there is a “cell-based” vaccine available this year in which the H3N2 component was grown in cell culture.) Health officials still recommend a yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older, because it’s still the best way to prevent flu. (LiveScience-Dec.8th) When would you rush to the hospital when you have Flu? Whether you rush to see your doctor or the hospital the main symptom that people should watch for is shortness of breath, When you get to the stage of breathlessness means that you are about to progress into pneumonia. How do you differentiate a Streptococcal sore throat from common cold and Flu? In the common cold, there’s coughing, sneezing, or a runny nose, indicating that it is not a streptococcal sore throat. Throat infection with strep bacteria can cause a variety of symptoms associated with inflammation of the throat. Strep sore throat starts with fever, sudden sore throat, and swollen tender lymph nodes in the neck which you can feel. Swallowing becomes painful. There may be white or yellow patches seen in the throat and tonsils. These symptoms are accompanied with headache, and even stomach ache, with nausea and vomiting. Look at your throat in the mirror with the help of a torch; you’ll notice how the throat lining looks red and angry. It is contagious and airborne droplets on sneezing can spread the infection. Some people carry these bacteria without causing any symptoms and referred to as carriers. Streptococcal sore throat will respond to antibiotics. Your doctor will prescribe penicillin or cephalosporin antibiotics to get rid of the infection. Other popular antibiotics prescribed are amoxicillin, cloxacillin and dicloxacillin, among others. Should you take antibiotics for a streptococcal throat infection? When you go to your doctor with a sore throat, he may write a quick prescription for penicillin or amoxicillin, and with the stroke of the pen, helps diminish public health and your own future health by helping bacteria evolve resistance to antibiotics. It is better to develop a spray-on treatment with bacteriophages, or take home remedies rather than taking antibiotics on the first occurrence, Ultimately, your immune system will subside the strepto’ throat infection. Antibiotic therapy for such conditions given may also destroy your gut microbes that helps creat immune system. Streptococcal sore throats can lead to rheumatic heart disease, a deadly condition that is very rare in the industrial world, but it still takes a toll in other parts of the world. What is sinus infection? Sinuses are empty spaces with mucus lining on either side of the nostrils in relation to the cheek bones called maxillary sinuses, and also there are similar spaces above your eye brows called frontal sinuses, and behind the nose called ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. These chambers communicate with the nasal passages and drain the mucus discharges. These sinuses could get infected with viruses or bacteria, or allergies causes are the most common. These sinuses could get inflamed from a virus such as the common cold, and invariably lead to bacterial colonization and cause a bacterial sinus infection- we call it sinusitis. You could get a yellowish or greenish discharge from your nostrils, sore throat, headache, fever, pain in the forehead, or between the eyes, toothache, and feeling of fullness in the mid-face, stuffy nose and congestion. You need to consult your doctor before using any drugs to treat your sinusitis. New findings- Gut microbial interaction Picture three people seated side by side on an airplane. The person in the middle gets flu and starts coughing. The person on the left gets the flu whilst the person seated on the right escapes. How can you explain this? The gut microbiota produce a molecule called “desaminotyrosine” (DAT). This molecule is formed in the microbiota from dietary polyphenols called flavonoids which has anti-oxidant properties. These flavonoids compounds are found in chocolate, tea and red wine. DAT seems to work on the immune system, formed by microbiota. This boost prevents the flu virus affecting the lungs reducing the lung damage. The researchers found that a microbe called Clostridium orbiscindens produced DAT. So the person on the right did not contract the flu mainly because he had this microbe in his gut to produce the flavonoid DAT, and escapes malady. So, next time you are on the plane and your next seat passenger starts coughing, drink Tea and eat chocolate and you’ll not go wrong. Conclusions: Stay at home and rest, hydrate yourself, enjoy chicken soup and other juices to hydrate you. Paracetamol should be okay for aches and pains. There is no cure unlike for bacterial infections, and time is the healer. This article also helps you to differentiate between many infections having similar symptoms.

Sometimes we forget important people, dates, events, etc.,so, as your Editor, I feel that it is my responsibility to keep all of you informed. As we all know, His Royal Highness Prince Harry got married just recently, but how many of you know, that, after his “bachelor-party” he uttered what could well be the “quote of the year”. He said “It’s really weird, stuffing money into a stripper’s G-string when every note has a picture of your grandmother on it”!! In addition, folks, here are a few” trivia” questions that I would like to throw your way. If you could answer any, obviously, your I.Q. would be envied, but, please do not worry, the answers follow, plus the “common” advice given gratis, which you must follow. In the year 1923, who was, 1 The President of the largest steel company? 2. The President of the largest gas company? 3. President of the New York Stock Exchange? 4. The greatest “wheat” speculator, ever? 5. Pres. of the bank of International Settlement? 6. The “great-bear” of Wall Street? These men were considered some of the most successful in the World, of their era. Now, 80 years later, history books inquire as to what ultimately happened to these tycoons? . Well, 1. The President of the largest Steel Company, whose name was Charles Schwab died a pauper. 2. The President of the largest gas company whose name was Edward Hopson went insane. 3. The President of the NYSE Richard Whitney was released from prison, only to die at home. 4. The greatest wheat speculator, Arthur Cooger died abroad, penniless. 5. The President of the B of I.S. shot himself & died. 6. The “great-bear” of Wall St., Cosabee Livermore, also committed suicide. All the above gentlemen worked their arses off to hopefully become multi-millionaires, while, back in 1923, the P.G.A. Champion & winner of the most important golf tournament, the U.S Open, whose name was Gene Sarazen, enjoyed his life, doing everything that we folks generally do, became financially secure in later life, played golf until he was 92, & died in 1999, at the ripe old age of 95.

The year 2005 saw him get the credit he truly deserved in Texas, 2013, in Houston, but, what has he got to do to be inducted into “THE COUNTRY HALL OF FAME”, covering the whole American Country ?. I need nothing at all, right now, except this music that I love, the respect & admiration of my own family & just a few genuine friends that “keep in touch”, writing for eLanka, still composing the “Country Love Songs” as I have done for well over 60 years now, still reading everything interesting that I can lay my hands on, especially about ” Artistes” like Gene Watson, a vocalist who can take ANY SONG and make it his own. There are hundreds of exceptionally talented Singers & Songwriters in both Australia & America. The only difference being the fact that those in America are much luckier with the “backing” they get for their recordings. Even having all this, to be inducted into the main Country Music Hall of Fame, over there, seems extremely difficult. I truly believe that Gene Watson should be in this Hall of Fame & if, during the past 5 years, he has still not been inducted into it, I would suggest that those who are responsible for the induction process, have their collective “hearing- aids” cleaned or replaced with new ones. I need nothing at all, having the necessary experience to KNOW what a good song sounds like, the melody, the lyrics & the “feeling” with which a good song is sung. I would ask my Lankan/Aussie readers everywhere to “comment” on the Gene Watson “clips” that go with this article, to try and get this superb singer into the ” Hall of Fame”, where he belongs.

The wife of still another icon of “Country Music”, Waylon Jennings who has now passed on to the “stage in the sky”, and mother of their son, Shooter, Jessi never ever took a step back, in showing her love for “Outlaw-Waylon”who, in turn, gave the impression that he could not believe his luck when he made this beautiful woman his wife. Watching them together, as they “did their thing” it was always easy to see the love they had for one another, and when Waylon finished his stint on Earth, Jessi wrote and performed songs dedicated to him, songs that proved beyond any doubt that she idolized “her man”. ” I’m not Lisa ” was only one of many top “hits” written by Jessi Colter, and I doubt that any other female star would even come close in “covering” this song, not even “Julie” that Jessi brings into her song. Waylon Jennings was one lucky man of Country Music. He was really “2 Stars in 1”, himself & his wife, Jessi Colter. I feel privileged even to “write” about her. In my “clips” of this beautiful woman, she poses with her handsome young son, Shooter, and a sonewhat older Kris Kristofferson.  “GO, JESSI”, you are one of the BEST in my opinion.

Eileen had her primary and secondary schooling at Holy Family Convent and had a brilliant academic record throughout.  She won the Senior Cambridge Scholarship Exam, coming first in the Island and was the Head Girl at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya from 1938 – 1941.  Eileen was one the editorial team for the school magazine, “ Refreshing Breezes .” At a time when women were not encouraged to study beyond Year 10, one would imagine there was very little support or assistance for women to enter University.  Eileen had to compete with students from prestigious boy’s schools that had far more resources and thereby some of the best teachers.  But this did not deter Eileen; she was determined and focussed.  Eileen was the first woman in her family to get a University education and so started her life-long passion for learning, education and teaching.  After graduating from the University of Colombo with a BA (English Hons), she joined her beloved Alma Mater as a teacher. We were indeed privileged to have her as our teacher at that time.  Apart from being our teacher, Eileen was also a friend and confidante and I remember the great times we all had at Holy Family. In 1955, Eileen left Holy Family Bambalapitiya when she married Aloysius de Silva (Aloy), a successful lawyer from Kurunegala.  She lived in Kurunegala with Aloy and her 3 daughters:  Marie-lyse, Diane & Sandra who each excelled in their chosen professions. Eileen later returned to teaching, this time at Holy Family Kurunegala until she retired at the age of 60!  Not content to be a ‘lady at large’ Eileen qualified as a Speech & Drama teacher obtaining a Licentiate and Fellow of the Trinity College of London whereupon she set up her own business as a teacher of Speech & Drama in Kurunegala. Eileen moved to Australia in 1998 and quickly adapted to the Australian lifestyle.  Her deep faith and her loving family sustained her although she was so far away from the places she called home.  She got involved in the local activities in Lane Cove (U3A, Senior Citizens, teaching Scripture etc.,) and thereby made a number of friends. Eileen loved writing, specially poetry.  In 2002, Eileen published a collection of poems called “Ripples on a Lake”. These poems presented a broad spectrum of scenes, feelings and situations from her past as well as from the present and showed her love for the experience that is life.  All copies sold at the launch and she was absolutely thrilled with the result and could not be persuaded to publish any more. Eileen also loved music, drama and singing (having trained choirs both at Holy Family Bambalapitiya and Holy Family Kurunegala and produced a number of plays as a teacher).  She was a proud member of a unique Sri Lankan choir (representing the various ethnic and religious groups from Sri Lanka) which sang at many venues in Sydney including at the Sydney Opera House. Eileen was a teacher who instilled in us a thirst for knowledge and deep passion for learning.  She loved teaching with a passion; she gave it her all and encouraged and inspired her students to reach for the stars.  She has been instrumental in shaping the careers of many a young woman over the years and we were indeed very fortunate to have been under her tutelage. At a personal and human level, Eileen touched many hearts and minds.  She was outgoing, friendly and generous.  She was a strong woman who loved teaching with a fierce passion.  She inspired, guided and moulded countless numbers of young minds to reach their full potential.  I will always remember Eileen with great fondness and as an exceptional teacher and a dear friend; as a woman of value. May she Rest in Peace.

Food prices eased on a sequential basis as well, led by vegetables, sea fish, onions and coconut. Non-food prices on the other hand, showed mild signs of pick up after easing for six continuous months. ‘Alcohol and beverage’, health, transport and recreation index picked up both on an annual and sequential basis, while that of ‘clothing and footwear’ eased. Core inflation mirrored this mild pick-up. Recent trends of moderation in food prices along with the statistical impact of last year’s high base is expected to keep inflation within the central bank’s target range of 4-6%. We forecast inflation to average 4.3% in 2018. The Central Bank of Sri Lanka in its April meeting reduced the upper bound of the policy rate corridor, i.e. cut the Standard Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 25bps to 8.5%. Easing inflation, stabilizing inflation expectations, cooling credit growth, and weak economic growth in 2017 warranted a reduction in the policy rate, according to the CBSL.

(Daily News 2.5.2018) Plantations Minister Naveen Dissanayake said yesterday that the ban on glyphosate had been lifted for tea and rubber plantations from yesterday. However, the ban would be in force as regards paddy and other cultivations, the minister told a press conference in Colombo. Glyphosate was banned in 2015. Independent MP Ven Athuraliye Ratana has stated that he would take to the streets against the government if the ban on glyphosate is lifted. The tea and rubber planters continued to plead with the government to lift the ban as their cultivations suffered severely because of the ban as traditional use of labour to remove weeds was expensive. (Daily Island, 3.5.2018) Wellawaya Magistrate Kesara Samaradivakara imposed fines amounting to Rs 410,000 on three persons, found guilty of possessing 33 kilos of dried venison. They had been nabbed in the act of selling bush meat in the Kirinoyagalrena area, on the border of Lungamvehera National Park, by Wildlife Conservation Department officials. Two shotguns and a threewheeler, used by them, too, were taken into custody and produced before courts. The wildlife officials informed the court that when they raided the illicit meat selling point one of the suspects had fled. He was later apprehended with the help of information divulged by the other two suspects. The one who made an abortive bid to flee was fined Rs. 170,000 and the other two were fined Rs 120,000 each for the offence of keeping wild game meat in their possession. (Daily Island 4.5.2018) An Inbound Health Assessment programme will be established in Sri Lanka to screen foreigners who apply for long stay visas for TB, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and filaria, International Organization for Migration (IOM), Sri Lanka said in a press release. On Friday (04) IOM Sri Lanka Chief of Mission Giuseppe Crocetti signed an MoU with the Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Janaka Sugathadasa to establish the health screening programme. “Since the end of Sri Lanka’s long running civil conflict in 2009, the country has seen a significant increase in foreign investment and tourist arrivals. Mega investment projects such as the Colombo Port City, Hambantota Port and the signing of several free trade agreements with neighboring countries have resulted in a spike in arrivals of foreign nationals, including migrant workers with applications for both residence and work visas increasing rapidly,” The IOM said in a press release. Since many of the migrant workers arrive from countries with a higher disease burden than Sri Lanka, which has made progress in combating communicable diseases and since the country has some of the best health indicators in the region, the Sri Lankan health authorities recognize that in order to maintain these high health standards, they need to minimize possible public health risks posed by increased population mobility. “Anyone testing positive for any of the diseases will be referred to the government health system for treatment paid for through a health insurance scheme to be set up as part of the programme. While they undergo the prescribed treatment, they will be issued with an interim visa to stay in the country and will be monitored by the Health Ministry for treatment compliance. The interim visa will grant the same rights to work or study as the residence visa,” the press release read. “This cooperation framework is a first of its kind for IOM globally. It is a major achievement and reflects the long running partnership between IOM and Sri Lanka in advancing the migrant health agenda,” said IOM Sri Lanka Chief of Mission Giuseppe Crocetti. “Sri Lanka is globally appreciated for its public health achievement of having eliminated malaria and filaria, and keeping HIV and tuberculosis at low prevalence.

When monthly change is considered, the NCPI increased from 122.8 index points in March 2018 to 122.9 index points in April 2018 mainly due to the increase in prices of the items in the Non-food category, particularly that of Transport (fuel price increase by the LIOC); and Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco. Meanwhile, price declines were observed in Food category particularly that of vegetables, big onions and coconuts as a result of improved supply conditions. The NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, remained unchanged at 1.9 per cent in April 2018 on year-on-year basis.

(Daily Financial Times, 28.5.2018) Sri Lanka has accepted an eight-year China Development Bank $ 1 billion syndicated loan to repay loans maturing this year, two top Finance Ministry officials said on Friday.he bank was chosen from among four bidding for the loan, which the Government plans to use towards repaying other loans, one official told Reuters. “All three others had three-year tenure and only China Development Bank had a bid for an eight-year tenure. The effective rate of return is around 5.3%,” the official said. “It was a good offer. The loan has a three-year grace period. Then in the next five years, the government will be repaying $ 100 million biannually.” The new borrowing comes after Sri Lanka raised a record $ 2.5 billion via two tranches of sovereign bonds last month. The Government is also preparing to refinance big debts that fall due up to 2022, with the start this year of repayments on expensive infrastructure foreign loans. The Government has blamed “colossal borrowing” by the previous government for the spike in debt servicing. Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera said last week the debt crisis would further worsen next year, when $ 4.3 billion has to be paid for debt servicing in 2019. Some 77% of next year’s repayments are for debts obtained by the previous government, he said. Sri Lanka, which has a $ 87 billion economy, expects foreign currency outflows of $ 6.35 billion in the next 12 months including loans, securities, and deposits, compared with the current $ 9.1 billion in foreign exchange reserves, according to the latest official Central Bank data. The Cabinet has approved plans to borrow some $ 5 billion in 2018 to refinance the debts due this year. The island nation plans overall net foreign borrowing of Rs. 300 billion ($ 1.90 billion) this year, 9.1% lower than 2017, budget data showed. (Daily Financial Times 28.5.2018) The Erste Bank of Austria has provided EUR 9.5 million (approximately Rs.1,810 million) interest-free credit facilities to enhance the access to quality and modern healthcare facilities in hospitals in the country. The Government, having recognised the importance, has now been able to provide anaesthetic machines, ICU ventilators, blood gas analysers, endoscopes, operation theatres and mobile lights for identified hospitals in Sri Lanka. The objectives of the project are to reduce hospital-acquired infections, ensure access to modern healthcare equipment so as to provide immediate care to the patients whilst reducing the recurrent costs and expenditure to the Government. Accordingly, the people in the entire country will be benefitted through this project by enhancing access to quality healthcare facilities. (Daily Financial Times 28.5.2018). The situation in the south-western part of the country slowly got back to normal on Monday after an extreme pre-monsoonal weather condition that caused 24 deaths, floods, landslides, as well as major traffic disruptions and school closures over the last week.

What is the nbn? The nbn network is a Federal Government initiative to replace the existing network that delivers home phone and internet services.  In areas where nbn’s fibre network is being introduced, you will need to move your home phone and internet services over to the nbn network if you want them to keep working.  As a wholesaler, nbn does not sell directly to the public, so you need to contact a phone or internet provider such as Telstra to move your services over to the nbn network. How do I connect to the nbn network? Once the nbn network is available in your area, a service provider like Telstra can help you get set up with the broadband and home phone services to suit your needs. Visit your local Telstra Store or contact Telstra on 1800 834 273 to discuss your transition to the nbn network and Telstra’s range of bundle options. You can check whether the nbn network is available in your area using the roll-out map here . What type of modem do I need to connect to the nbn network? Your service provider will be able to recommend the correct modem, as it will depend on the type of nbn connection available to your premises. All new customers signing up to a Telstra home internet bundle, or existing Telstra customers moving to the nbn network who don’t already have an nbn-compatible modem, will receive a Telstra Smart Modem™ to help keep you connected throughout your transition. Once plugged in, the modem will connect a home to the internet via the mobile network, without having to wait for the fixed service to be connected. If there’s an interruption to your broadband service, the gateway will automatically switch over to a mobile connection within minutes. What Telstra services are available to me over the nbn network? Telstra offers a range of services and products including a home phone and internet that works via an nbn connection. An International calling pack from Telstra provides unlimited calls to fixed line and mobiles in selected overseas destinations including India, Bangladesh, UK, Canada and US among others. Telstra also offers unique products to create your connected home including Telstra Smart Home that allows you to automate lighting, appliances and monitor your home when you’re not there by connecting a range of smart devices through a central hub and app. A world of on-demand entertainment content is also available through Telstra TV (which has premium South Asian content on Yupp TV) as well as Foxtel Now. Where can I find out more information in my local area? Visit your local Telstra store to speak to one of our friendly staff about getting connected to the nbn with Australia’s best network. Head to Telstra.com.au/Telstra-store to look up your nearest store and book an appointment for personalised technical guidance from an advisor. Once the nbn network is available in your area, a service provider like Telstra can help you get set up with the broadband and home phone services to suit your needs.

The smell of the oil was appetizing, just the same smell you got from poonac pieces a biproduct fed to the cattle. This oil was obtained from stone crushing appliances found in most kitchens in coconut plantation districts along the sea coast. That was a cottage industry at that time. The coconut kernel was shelled out and burnt in the hot sun for many days- called copra and used to extract the oil. Then, came the bottled coconut oil started by the BCC company in Hultsdorf in Colombo. They processed the oil into a colorless watery liquid oil, became popular and easy to buy from the boutiques and grocery shops. Presently, there are a variety of brands of coconut oil bottled up and sold as coconut oil. A few years ago, a virgin coconut oil was discovered that came to the market. Virgin coconut oil has been the subject of extensive studies by many respected doctors, among them Dr. Bruce Fife, whose 15-year research and surveys can be found in Pub Med, the largest database of medical science in the US National Library of Medicine (https://www.pubmed.gov). Instead of extracting the oil from dried brownish color coconut copra, fresh coconut was scraped, dried under a temperature below 60degC to avoid discoloration and to reduce moisture level of the coconut to an 8%. This product was further dried under right temperature and cooled down to room temperature and is fed to a pressing cylinder for cold -pressing to produce a colorless and odorless virgin coconut oil. No chemicals were used to process the oil. This virgin coconut oil product is more solid at room temperature and freezes into creamy ointment -like texture during winter-months and needs to be scooped out with strength, like ice cream being scooped out. Though it is creamy you still could feel the tiny fragments of coconut which gives it an appetizing appearance. Virgin coconut oil is sold in most countries in wide open jars for easy scooping out. Recently, on our visit to Sri Lanka, we did our marketing in a super-market in Peradeniya Road, Kandy. My wife purchased a bottle of virgin coconut oil which surprised me when used as a cooking oil. It did not have much of a smell of coconut and very watery in consistency, and the label declared it was virgin coconut oil. Most people in Sri Lanka wouldn’t bother to know the difference between virgin or other processed coconut oils. They wouldn’t know the health benefits of the virgin oil in preference to the processed oil and the manufacturers can cheat by labelling processed oil and label as virgin coconut oils. The picture above depicts the bottle of ‘so called ‘virgin coconut oil purchased from the supermarket. When you purchase virgin coconut oil, check the consistency of the oil by looking through and shaking the bottle. At room temperature, especially in air-conditioned supermarkets the oil will demonstrate a degree of snowy appearance and should not look like a processed watery oil. People living in cold climatic conditions should purchase the oil in wide mouth jars for easy scoop. The coconut research Institute in Lunuwila, Sri Lanka did produce high quality virgin coconut oil in the nineties and I remember, I was sent two bottles from the first production. Subsequently, due to demand of the product virgin coconut oil manufactured in Kerala appeared on our supermarket shelves. Today, the genuine virgin coconut oil bottles and jars seem to be lacking in our supermarkets and what’s sold is what’s described above and depicted in the picture. The health benefits of virgin coconut oil are not discussed here, in preference to the processed adulterated oils in the market. Hope this article will enlighten the topic for those interested in purchasing the genuine unprocessed oil.

But her enthusiasm for dancing was there since she was in very little age. Therefore she kept her first step in dancing at the age of 03 from Daya Nellampitiya and with a solid foundation received from there, after 05 years she selected Kulasiri Budawatta as her instructor. There she studied for 12 years and got all experience & abilities. During that period she performed at many occasions locally and also internationally. Though she went through extensive studies under Budawatta, her eagerness for dancing never constrained from there, she went India for further studies, there she continues her studies for another 2 years period & gained the knowledge of Latin & Indian styles for a great extend. Since then Prashadi’s dance addiction, has as taken her across many countries & she performed in many occasions, also she had the opportunity to perform with many internationally recognized cartographers & dancers, Such as Terrance Lewis.

No doubt you’ve heard of SOS Children’s Villages who run the most wonderful and loving homes for children throughout Sri Lanka. Whilst you may think they are 100% supported by an international NGO, that’s not the case. They’re currently funded partly by people like you and I. Back in 2001, a young girl, Anjalika, arrived on their doorstep. Alone and frightened by her new surroundings she took some time to settle in. After all, going from being without a close family to being planted in the middle of a large one was a whole new experience for her. But, she had such a strength of will she was determined to do something with her life. Tears of pride. Under the care of a loving mother and surrounded by a host of siblings, she flourished. “O” levels sailed by; “A” levels took a lot of work and her strength but she received top grades and many smiles of pride from her entire SOS family. A coveted place at a Government University beckoned and was accepted. Today, 3 years on, she’s ready to take her final exams after studying for a BSc in Psychology. The pride of her SOS Mother is palpable; the smiles of awe of her younger siblings are humbling to see. We think it’s amazing what SOS Children’s Villages are doing back in Sri Lanka, but it proves beyond doubt that the human spirit is alive thanks to those people (people like you and I) who supported them and enabled one child to achieve the greatest height. If you’d like to support SOS Children’s Village in Sri Lanka and help other kids achieve what Anjalika did, then give them a quick call on [+94 11 270 2712) or click here to be taken to their website . How many other children can achieve their life’s dream? A lot more with our collective help.

Built on a foundation of effective communication, the ULTC Personal Leadership & Life Skills Program for Youth is a unique program designed for youth aged 10-18 years, to create self- awareness as a key to personal development and personal leadership so that they can live their lives to their fullest potential. Purpose of ULTC is to develop self-confidence in youth and build up their self- esteem so that they are able to create their own unique path to success – success as defined by them, not a definition borrowed from others. Our aim is to create well-balanced, all-rounded individuals who are independent and self-reliant, but comfortably interdependent. The unique feature of ULTC program is the learning of skills through facilitator led interactive peer learning sessions in a fulfilled environment. Our focus is on incremental development through continual hands on practice. The way the program is structured, it allows plenty of opportunity for the members to practise the skills taught in each session. In addition to public speaking, presentation and debating skills, they will learn essential life skills such as interpersonal communication, creative problem solving, organisation, time management and teamwork skills, and workplace etiquette.  The personal leadership skills taught are skills that can be applied in all educational, career and social settings throughout a member’s life. We strongly believe in empowering our youth at an early age to face and deal with the ever-increasing demand and challenges of the current world and define and achieve their own path of success in their life. The program is delivered on a fortnightly basis on Sundays at Baulkham hills Community Centre, Windsor Road Baulkham Hills.  There are eight sessions per semester and two semesters per year.

When the iconic performer passed away in 2016, the world mourned the loss of the multi- instrumentalist who was ahead of his time musically. For Australian musician Andrew De Silva, this loss was keenly felt. Undeniably something that was meant to be, Purple Revolution had their first show only a couple of weeks before Prince passed away. The Purple Revolution pays homage in a party fashion – after all, Prince penned some of the best songs in music history. With tracks such as Little Red Corvette, 1999, Cream, Kiss, I Wanna Be Your Lover and the iconic Purple Rain , audiences are guaranteed to be on their feet from start to finish. Prince’s hits smashed the Billboard Charts and created memories for generations – now Purple Revolution: A Tribute to Prince will endeavour to keep those memories alive. Whether you were a fan of Prince’s irrevocable style, or only discovered his catalogue after his passing, Purple Revolution is a show for all to enjoy. Jam-packed with hits, the show features guitar virtuoso Simon Hosford (Men At Work, Tommy Emmanuel), Paolo Cecchinelli (Kate Ceberano, Vanessa Amorosi), Rod Bustos (Kate Ceberano, Vanessa Amorosi) and drummer Johnny Salerno (Belinda Carlisle, Jon Stevens). The band have now added a touch female energy to the show with singer/dancer Juanita Timpanaro. Juanita like Andrew, an obsessed Prince fan, brings to life the songs Prince performed with Sheila E & Sheena Easton. When it comes to an artist performing Prince’s material, then Andrew De Silva is confidently placed to do so. There is little he can’t do – from fronting R&B supergroup CDB in the 1990s, to pub rock icons Boom Crash Opera nowadays, Andrew is also an established singer-songwriter within his own right, winning the 2012 Australia’s Got Talent for his incredible vocal style.
